# Lukaut — Brand Guidelines

## Brand Overview

### Name
**Lukaut** (pronounced "look-out")

### Origin
Lukaut derives from Tok Pisin, the creole language of Papua New Guinea. It translates directly to "look out," "watch," or "be careful"—a fitting name for a safety inspection platform. The name carries authentic meaning while remaining approachable and memorable to English speakers.

### Tagline
**"You inspect. We'll handle the rest."**

This tagline captures the Alfred-to-Batman relationship at the core of Lukaut's brand. It:
- Clearly positions the inspector as the expert and decision-maker
- Acknowledges their skill ("You inspect")
- Promises to remove the tedious burden ("We'll handle the rest")
- Implies partnership without overstepping
- Feels supportive, not replacive

## Voice & Tone

### Voice Principles

**1. Clear over clever**
Say what you mean. Avoid jargon, puns, or wordplay that obscures the message.

```
✗ "Let's revolutionize your inspection paradigm!"
✓ "Create reports in half the time."
```

**2. Confident, not boastful**
State capabilities directly without superlatives or hype.

```
✗ "The world's most advanced AI-powered inspection platform!"
✓ "AI that helps you catch violations and cite regulations accurately."
```

**3. Respectful of expertise**
The inspector is the expert. Lukaut assists; it doesn't replace professional judgment.

```
✗ "Lukaut automatically identifies all safety violations."
✓ "Lukaut flags potential violations for your review."
```

**4. Concise**
Inspectors are busy. Respect their time in every interaction.

```
✗ "We've identified what appears to be a potential issue that you might want to take a closer look at."
✓ "Potential violation detected. Review suggested."
```

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Marketing | Confident, direct | "Faster reports. Fewer missed violations." |
| Onboarding | Helpful, encouraging | "Let's set up your first inspection." |
| In-app prompts | Minimal, functional | "3 potential violations found" |
| Error states | Calm, solution-focused | "Upload failed. Try a smaller image or check your connection." |
| Success states | Brief, affirming | "Report generated." |

### Words We Use

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Inspection | Audit (unless context requires) |
| Violation | Issue, problem, concern |
| Report | Document, paperwork |
| Potential | Possible, maybe |
| Review | Check, look at |
| Flag | Alert, warn, notify |
| Accurate | Perfect, flawless |
| Fast | Instant, lightning-fast |

### Words We Avoid

- **Hype words:** Revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge, next-gen
- **Vague claims:** Best-in-class, world-class, industry-leading
- **Fear-based:** Don't get sued, avoid liability, protect yourself
- **Overly technical:** Neural network, machine learning model, algorithm (in user-facing copy)

## Visual Identity

### Logo Direction

#### Concept
The logo should convey **watchfulness** and **protection** without being literal (no hard hats, warning signs, or cartoon eyes). It should feel modern and software-native while being appropriate for a professional B2B context.

#### Logo Approaches

**Option A: Wordmark Only**
A clean, custom wordmark with subtle distinctiveness in the letterforms. The "L" or "k" could have a subtle visual treatment suggesting vigilance or sight.

*Pros:* Simple, versatile, easy to reproduce
*Cons:* Less distinctive at small sizes

**Option B: Lettermark + Wordmark**
A stylized "L" mark that can stand alone as an icon, paired with the wordmark.

*Pros:* Flexible (icon for app, full logo for web), more distinctive
*Cons:* More complex to execute well

**Option C: Abstract Symbol + Wordmark**
A simple geometric symbol suggesting oversight, vision, or protection—paired with the wordmark.

*Pros:* Most distinctive, scalable
*Cons:* Risk of being too abstract or generic

**Recommendation:** Option B (Lettermark + Wordmark) — provides flexibility for app icon, favicon, and full logo usage while maintaining brand recognition.

#### Logo Principles

- **Simplicity:** Must work at 16x16px (favicon) and on a hard hat sticker
- **No literal imagery:** Avoid hard hats, clipboards, checkmarks, warning triangles
- **Geometric foundation:** Clean lines, intentional shapes
- **Single color capable:** Must work in single color for various applications

#### Logo Don'ts

- No gradients in primary mark
- No thin lines that disappear at small sizes
- No clip art or stock icon aesthetics
- No "tech startup" clichés (swooshes, orbits, abstract nodes)
- Avoid anything that feels like a "tech startup logo generator"

**Slate Gray (#64748B)** for secondary elements:
