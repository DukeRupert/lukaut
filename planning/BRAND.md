# Lukaut — Brand Guidelines

## Brand Overview

### Name
**Lukaut** (pronounced "look-out")

### Origin
Lukaut derives from Tok Pisin, the creole language of Papua New Guinea. It translates directly to "look out," "watch," or "be careful"—a fitting name for a safety inspection platform. The name carries authentic meaning while remaining approachable and memorable to English speakers.

### Tagline
**"You inspect. We'll handle the rest."**

This tagline captures the Alfred-to-Batman relationship at the core of Lukaut's brand. It:
- Clearly positions the inspector as the expert and decision-maker
- Acknowledges their skill ("You inspect")
- Promises to remove the tedious burden ("We'll handle the rest")
- Implies partnership without overstepping
- Feels supportive, not replacive

## Voice & Tone

### Voice Principles

**1. Clear over clever**
Say what you mean. Avoid jargon, puns, or wordplay that obscures the message.

```
✗ "Let's revolutionize your inspection paradigm!"
✓ "Create reports in half the time."
```

**2. Confident, not boastful**
State capabilities directly without superlatives or hype.

```
✗ "The world's most advanced AI-powered inspection platform!"
✓ "AI that helps you catch violations and cite regulations accurately."
```

**3. Respectful of expertise**
The inspector is the expert. Lukaut assists; it doesn't replace professional judgment.

```
✗ "Lukaut automatically identifies all safety violations."
✓ "Lukaut flags potential violations for your review."
```

**4. Concise**
Inspectors are busy. Respect their time in every interaction.

```
✗ "We've identified what appears to be a potential issue that you might want to take a closer look at."
✓ "Potential violation detected. Review suggested."
```

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Marketing | Confident, direct | "Faster reports. Fewer missed violations." |
| Onboarding | Helpful, encouraging | "Let's set up your first inspection." |
| In-app prompts | Minimal, functional | "3 potential violations found" |
| Error states | Calm, solution-focused | "Upload failed. Try a smaller image or check your connection." |
| Success states | Brief, affirming | "Report generated." |

### Words We Use

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Inspection | Audit (unless context requires) |
| Violation | Issue, problem, concern |
| Report | Document, paperwork |
| Potential | Possible, maybe |
| Review | Check, look at |
| Flag | Alert, warn, notify |
| Accurate | Perfect, flawless |
| Fast | Instant, lightning-fast |

### Words We Avoid

- **Hype words:** Revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge, next-gen
- **Vague claims:** Best-in-class, world-class, industry-leading
- **Fear-based:** Don't get sued, avoid liability, protect yourself
- **Overly technical:** Neural network, machine learning model, algorithm (in user-facing copy)

## Visual Identity

### Logo Direction

#### Concept
The logo should convey **watchfulness** and **protection** without being literal (no hard hats, warning signs, or cartoon eyes). It should feel modern and software-native while being appropriate for a professional B2B context.

#### Logo Approaches

**Option A: Wordmark Only**
A clean, custom wordmark with subtle distinctiveness in the letterforms. The "L" or "k" could have a subtle visual treatment suggesting vigilance or sight.

*Pros:* Simple, versatile, easy to reproduce
*Cons:* Less distinctive at small sizes

**Option B: Lettermark + Wordmark**
A stylized "L" mark that can stand alone as an icon, paired with the wordmark.

*Pros:* Flexible (icon for app, full logo for web), more distinctive
*Cons:* More complex to execute well

**Option C: Abstract Symbol + Wordmark**
A simple geometric symbol suggesting oversight, vision, or protection—paired with the wordmark.

*Pros:* Most distinctive, scalable
*Cons:* Risk of being too abstract or generic

**Recommendation:** Option B (Lettermark + Wordmark) — provides flexibility for app icon, favicon, and full logo usage while maintaining brand recognition.

#### Logo Principles

- **Simplicity:** Must work at 16x16px (favicon) and on a hard hat sticker
- **No literal imagery:** Avoid hard hats, clipboards, checkmarks, warning triangles
- **Geometric foundation:** Clean lines, intentional shapes
- **Single color capable:** Must work in single color for various applications

#### Logo Don'ts

- No gradients in primary mark
- No thin lines that disappear at small sizes
- No clip art or stock icon aesthetics
- No "tech startup" clichés (swooshes, orbits, abstract nodes)
- Avoid anything that feels like a "tech startup logo generator"

### Color Palette

The Lukaut color palette draws inspiration from Papua New Guinea—the origin of the brand name. This creates a distinctive visual identity that stands apart from typical SaaS blues and purples while carrying authentic meaning.

#### Primary Colors

| Color | Name | Hex | RGB | Inspiration | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-----|-------------|-------|
| | **Forest Deep** | `#1A4D2E` | 26, 77, 46 | PNG highlands rainforest | Primary brand color, headers, logo |
| | **Paradise Gold** | `#FCD116` | 252, 209, 22 | Bird-of-Paradise, PNG flag | Accent, CTAs, highlights |
| | **Cloud White** | `#FAFAFA` | 250, 250, 250 | Southern Cross, clarity | Primary backgrounds |

| | **Caution Amber** | `#F59E0B` | 245, 158, 11 | Warnings, attention needed |

#### Color Rationale

**Forest Deep (#1A4D2E)** as primary:

- Conveys growth, safety, stability
- Professional and serious without being cold

**Paradise Gold (#FCD116)** as accent:
- Directly from PNG flag
- High visibility for CTAs
- Creates energy and draws attention to key actions
- Beautiful contrast with Forest Deep

**Sepik Clay (#8B7355)** for secondary elements:
- Named for the Sepik River region
- Earthy, grounded, human warmth
- Excellent for secondary text and borders
- Softens the overall palette

**Tapa Cream (#E8E4DF)** for backgrounds:
- References traditional bark cloth art
- Warmer than clinical white
- Easier on eyes for extended use
- Distinctive from typical SaaS white-box aesthetic

#### Color Usage Guidelines

```
Primary Background:     Cloud White (#FAFAFA) or Tapa Cream (#E8E4DF)
Primary Text:           Tribal Black (#1A1A1A)
Secondary Text:         Sepik Clay (#8B7355)
Primary CTA:            Paradise Gold (#FCD116) with Forest Deep text
Secondary CTA:          Forest Deep (#1A4D2E) with Cloud White text
Links:                  Forest Deep (#1A4D2E)
Borders/Dividers:       Sepik Clay (#8B7355) at 30% opacity
Header/Navigation:      Forest Deep (#1A4D2E) with Cloud White text
```

#### Accessibility Compliance

| Combination | Contrast Ratio | WCAG Rating |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Tribal Black on Cloud White | 18.1:1 | AAA ✓ |
| Tribal Black on Tapa Cream | 12.4:1 | AAA ✓ |
| Forest Deep on Cloud White | 9.2:1 | AAA ✓ |
| Cloud White on Forest Deep | 9.2:1 | AAA ✓ |
| Forest Deep on Paradise Gold | 8.7:1 | AAA ✓ |
| Sepik Clay on Cloud White | 4.6:1 | AA ✓ |

**Important:** Never use Paradise Gold as a text color on light backgrounds—it fails contrast requirements. Use it only for buttons, icons, and decorative elements with Forest Deep or Tribal Black text.
