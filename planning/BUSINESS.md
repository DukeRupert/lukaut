## Brand Identity

### Name & Origin

**Lukaut** (pronounced "look-out") derives from Tok Pisin, the creole language of Papua New Guinea. It translates directly to "look out," "watch," or "be careful"—a fitting name for a safety inspection platform. The name carries authentic cultural meaning while remaining approachable and memorable to English speakers.

### Tagline

**"You inspect. We'll handle the rest."**

This tagline captures the Alfred-to-Batman relationship at the core of Lukaut's brand:
- Positions the inspector as the expert and decision-maker
- Acknowledges their skill ("You inspect")
- Promises to remove the tedious burden ("We'll handle the rest")
- Implies partnership without overstepping

### Brand Personality

Lukaut is **the reliable colleague**—the experienced coworker who's seen it all but never makes you feel inexperienced. They're efficient, thorough, and steady. They don't grandstand or over-explain. When they flag something, you trust it.

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Reliable | Consistent, dependable, always available |
| Observant | Catches details, thorough, nothing slips by |
| Practical | No fluff, gets the job done, respects your time |
| Supportive | Assists without taking over |
| Confident | Sure of its findings, but not arrogant |

### Visual Identity

Lukaut's color palette is rooted in construction safety—industry-native colors that feel authoritative and trustworthy:

| Color | Name | Hex | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| | **Slate Navy** | `#1E3A5F` | Primary brand color, headers, nav |
| | **Safety Orange** | `#FF6B35` | Accent, CTAs, highlights |
| | **Clean White** | `#FEFEFE` | Page backgrounds |
| | **Soft Gray** | `#F3F4F6` | Cards, containers |
| | **Slate Gray** | `#64748B` | Secondary text, borders |
| | **Alert Red** | `#DC2626` | Errors, critical violations |

This construction-safety palette conveys trust and professionalism while being immediately recognizable to our target users.

### Brand Voice

- **Clear over clever** — Say what we mean, no jargon
- **Confident, not boastful** — State capabilities directly
- **Respectful of expertise** — The inspector is the expert; Lukaut assists
- **Concise** — Inspectors are busy; respect their time

## Product Purpose

### The Problem

Construction safety inspectors face a time-intensive, error-prone reporting process:

1. **Manual photo review** — Inspectors must carefully examine dozens of site photos to identify potential violations
2. **Regulation lookup** — Each violation requires finding and citing the correct OSHA or local safety codes, a tedious research task
3. **Report writing** — Violation descriptions must be written clearly and professionally for each issue
4. **Formatting and delivery** — Reports must be compiled into a presentable format with photos and citations

This process typically takes **1-2 hours per inspection**, limiting the number of inspections an independent inspector can complete per day and creating opportunities for human error.

### The Consequences of the Status Quo

- **Lost revenue** — Time spent on reports is time not spent on billable inspections
- **Liability exposure** — Missed violations or incorrect citations create legal and professional risk
- **Inconsistent quality** — Without standardization, report quality varies based on inspector fatigue, time pressure, and experience
- **Reputation risk** — Errors or omissions can damage an inspector's professional standing

### Our Solution

Lukaut addresses each pain point:

| Pain Point | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| Time-consuming photo review | AI analyzes images and flags potential safety violations |
| Tedious regulation lookup | AI suggests applicable OSHA/local codes for each violation |
| Manual description writing | AI drafts professional violation descriptions |
| Report formatting | One-click generation of print/email-ready reports |
| Inconsistent quality | Standardized templates with comprehensive coverage |

The inspector remains in full control—reviewing AI suggestions, accepting or rejecting identified violations, adding manual observations, and approving the final report. The AI accelerates the work; the human ensures accuracy.

## Market Niche

### Target Segment: Independent Construction Safety Inspectors

Our initial focus is narrow and intentional:

**Primary Target (MVP)**
- Independent safety inspectors and consultants
- Focused on construction site inspections
- Operating in Florida (year-round construction activity)
- Currently using manual processes (Word documents, PDF templates)

**Why This Segment**

1. **Underserved** — Enterprise safety software is expensive and complex; independents lack tailored tools
2. **Decision-maker is the user** — No lengthy procurement cycles; inspector can subscribe immediately
3. **Clear ROI** — Time savings translate directly to increased earning capacity
4. **Accessible for validation** — We have direct access to a domain expert for alpha/beta testing

**Future Expansion Path**

| Phase | Segment | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| MVP | Independent inspectors (FL) | Validate product-market fit |
| Phase 2 | Independent inspectors (US) | Scale within proven segment |
| Phase 3 | Small inspection firms (2-10 inspectors) | Add team features, volume pricing |
| Phase 4 | Enterprise / Multi-site | Custom integrations, compliance workflows |

### Regulatory Landscape

Construction safety inspections operate within a well-defined regulatory framework:

- **OSHA Standards** — Federal baseline (29 CFR 1926 for construction)
- **State OSHA Plans** — 22 states have approved state plans (Florida uses federal OSHA)
- **Local Building Codes** — Municipality-specific requirements

This structured regulatory environment is advantageous: the rules are documented, citations are standardized, and AI can be trained on authoritative source material.
